# Wumpus

A reboot of the early 80 text game.

Type the name of the doorway to go through.
You will be told the name of the doorway through which you entered your current room.
Type shoot <doorname> to shoot through the door and hit the wumpus on the other side.
Drafty rooms are next to a bottomless pit.
You only get one shot.

Good luck!
